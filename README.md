# Python-Learning
My repository for my Python projects from self learning.

<h1><b>Python</b></h1>

<h2><b>Beginner</b></h2>
Data Type - Strings, Ints, Floats, Booleans, Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries.
Control Flow / Loops - For loops, while loops, if/elif/else statements.
Arithmetic and Expressions
Input and Output - Sys module, Standard input/output, reading and writing of files.
Functions
Exceptions and Error Handling
Basic of object oriented programming

<h2><b>Intermediate</b></h2>

    Recursion

    Regular Expressions

    More advanced OOP - Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Method overloading.

    Data Structures - Linked lists, Stacks, Queues, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, Graphs, Minimum Spanning Trees, Hash Maps

    Algorithms - Linear Search, Binary Search, Hashing, Quicksort, Insertion/Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Radix Sort, Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, Prim's Algorithm, Dijkstra's Algorithm.

    Algorithmic Complexity

<h2><b>Advanced - A.I. / Machine Learning/ Data science</b></h2>

    Statistics

    Probability

    Brute Force search

    Heuristic search (Manhattan Distance, Admissible and Informed Heuristics)

    Hill Climbing

    Simulated Annealing

    A* search

    Adversarial Search (Minimax & Alpha-Beta pruning)

    Greedy Algorithms

    Dynamic Programming

    Genetic Algorithms

    Artificial Neural Networks

    Backpropagation

    Natural Language Processing

    Convolutional Neural Networks

    Recurrent Neural Networks

    Generative Adversarial Networks

<h2><b>Advanced - Full stack web development</b></h2>

    Computer networks (Don't need to go into heavy detail but an understanding is necessary)

    Backend web dev tools (flask, django) (This is for app logic, interfacing with databases etc).

    Front end framework (This is for communicating with the backend) (Angular 6+, React/Redux)

    With frontend you'll also need - HTML, CSS, Javascript (also good to learn typescript which is using in angular. It makes writing javascript nicer).

    Relational database (MySQL, PostgreSQL)

    Non-relational (MongoDB)

    Cloud computing knowledge is good, (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)

<h2><b>Other 'Must Knows'</b></h2>

    Version Control - Git (start using Github straight away, it's your portfolio!!!)

    SQL (Relational and Non-Relational Databases - Almost everywhere nowadays)

    Code Quality / Engineering Best Practices

    Basics of Cloud Computing - Pick a provider and start learning (AWS recommended - biggest selection of services)

    Scalable Systems Design - (https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer)
